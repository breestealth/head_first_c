Head First C
============

This repository is just for my study of the book, __Head First C__.

I am project manager with PMP. I am a programmer 3 years ago. I love coding and I can get funny from the program.

Also I love PM and I think I am much more better as a PM in a team rather than a programmer. But I will **never** give up program as a hobby.
